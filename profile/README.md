## Homework Assignments
[Homework 1](https://github.com/NYUAppSec/appsec_hw1) was originally written by  Professors 
[Brendan Dolan-Gavitt](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brendan-dolan-gavitt) and [Justin Cappos](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/justin-cappos). 
This assignment is about using manual and automated techniques to both find and repair bugs in C. 

[Homework 2](https://github.com/NYUAppSec/appsec_hw2) was originally created by [Kevin Gallagher](https://kgallagher.me/). 
This assignment covers both exploiting and fixing web application vulnerabilities. Then it goes over about secure key management and database encryption.

[Homework 3](https://github.com/NYUAppSec/appsec_hw3) was originally created by [Kevin Gallagher](https://kgallagher.me/). 
This assignment is about secure practice in Kubernetes, such as utilizing Sealed Secrets to store sensitive data, and utilizing prometheus to capture security metrics.

[Homework 4](https://github.com/NYUAppSec/appsec_hw4) was originally created by [Kevin Gallagher](https://kgallagher.me/). 
This assignment is about fixing a buggy mobile app that both has security misconfigurations and both identifying and removing code that can compromise a user's privacy.
